# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Tensor-flow-From-The-Real-Time-Camera
In this project we we have collected our own image datsets and trained with the Tensor flow model and testing is done from real time camera. 
To understand how this project is done you can follow the following steps:
-Step1: collecting of image datasets using our webcam camera
-Step2: labeling images using labelimg or or you can use other online labeling tools if you need 
-Step3: use pretrained(SSD mobile net model) to train the deeep learing model 
-Step4: testing the result using open CV on the real time camera .
